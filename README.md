### Conditional Logic

#### If Statements

```python 
if some_condition == True :```
	print("The condition is True")
elif some_other_condition == True :
  print("This condition is True")
else :
	print("The condition is False")
```

#### Trutiness

We can call values that will reslve to True ("truthy"), or values that will resolve False ("falsy").

Besides False conditional checks, other things that are naturally falsy include: empty objects, empty strings, None, and zero.
